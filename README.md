What the project does--
A Study on Music Therapy and Mental Health:
This project reviewed information regarding an individual's music listening habits and their perceived mental health. The data is from a Kaggle dataset from a survey posted in chatrooms and online forums. The data is broken into two parts. The first part is information about the user and their music preferences. This includes information like when they listen to music, how they listen to music, and what genre they listen to. The second part is data about mental health, specifically data about their self-reported experiences with things such as stress, anxiety, and depression.

Why the project is useful--
This project has early data analysis with some graphs and charts to visualize the information in the dataset. Hypothesis were then made regarding relationships between if individual's listening to music while working affect their anxiety levels, if an individual's favorite genre is classical music compared to if they believe musci worsens, improves, or has no effect on their mental health, and lastly if the amount of hours and individual listens to musci affects their anxiety levels. These were only three examples of tests that were run but more relationship and inferences could be made for the dataset which could explore the affects of music on mental health. 

How users can get started with the project--
Users can get started with the project by first analyzing the dataset and looking at the visualizations. From there they can either explore the inference tests that were run or run their own tests with hypotheses they make.
